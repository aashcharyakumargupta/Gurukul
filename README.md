# 📘 College Management System

A comprehensive College Management System built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack. This system is designed to streamline college administration processes, providing individual dashboards for admins, teachers, and students. It enables efficient management of college resources, attendance, fees, subjects, and more.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This College Management System is developed to assist college administrators in managing daily operations effectively. Each user role has access to specific features that enhance communication, resource management, and the overall educational experience.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (including Context API for state management, hooks, and custom components)
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js (REST API architecture)
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM for schema management)
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - **JWT**: For secure user authentication
  - **Bcrypt**: For password hashing
  - **Redis**: Used for robust session and attendance management (in-memory data store)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development machine:
- **Node.js**: version 14 or above
- **MongoDB**: (either MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB server)
- **Redis**: For session management (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak-cell311/college-management-system.git
   cd college-management-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For the backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # For the frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory with the following keys:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_url  # Optional if using Redis
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start both backend and frontend servers:

   ```bash
   # For the backend
   cd backend
   npm start

   # For the frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should be running on `https://gurukul-vw9n.vercel.app/` and the backend on `https://gurukul-vw9n.onrender.com`.
